# Choose Your Own Adventure Website Game
*The goal of this project is to create a website that a user will interact with to create their own pathway of scenarios. For example, a user will be presented with two options. Once the user clicks on an option, they will be prompted with 2 more options pertaining to each option thus doubling the possibilities each time.
